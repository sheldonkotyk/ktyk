The next day, he tested God again, and the opposite occurred. The ground was wet, but the fleece was dry. It was God again!'

        text: 'Gideon, like many of the important leaders in Israel’s history, had many reasons to doubt that God would choose him to rescue Israel. When God first called him, he was hiding at the bottom of a wine press, threshing grain because of fear, for good reason. Interestingly, God’s call to him was “Go with the strength you have, and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you!” (Judges 6:14, NLT)'

David, Moses, Gideon and every New Testament disciple were the opposite of who the world would have chosen to be their leaders. However, God did call them. He called them because they would have to depend on Him.'
