        text: "The problem: I run a department in a large non-profit. The team is spread out across multiple countries and time zones. We can't afford to meet together in person. People are feeling disconnected. When people feel disconnected, they lose creativity, collaboration, and it can lead to a lack of trusting each other.\_"

We always had a team that was spread out across the country but when hiring began again, we hired people that could work remotely. Soon, just a handful of our team was working full-time in the office. We were using tools like Slack and Hangouts to communicate.'

Sometimes the laughter is contagious, sometimes we talk about hard times that people are going through (if they want to of course.)
