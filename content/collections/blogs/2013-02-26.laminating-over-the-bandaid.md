        text: 'Unlike the human body, most projects aren’t able to fix themselves under a band-aid. If scope-creep is allowed without having the time and money to do it right, you may have a situation where bugs manifest days, weeks or years later. Sure, fixing the bugs may be cheaper in the short term and adding more features on top of the quick fixes is possible; unfortunately, it is like laminating on top of a band-aid. Eventually, it will become an issue and instead of pulling the bandaid, you’ll need to get out the heavy duty tools.'
