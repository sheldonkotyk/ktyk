        text: 'Trump destroyed their future. Their desire for Hillary to continue what Obama promised: equality for all, the climate fixed, and world peace was dashed as what they consider to be a racist, mysoginist, billionaire won the electoral college in a hacked election, stealing it with less votes than Hillary, making him illegitimate and therefore, not their president.'

        text: "As a Christian, I can honestly look at terrorism, an economy in ruins where people can't find well paying jobs, and a fear of the unknown and say that although I don't have answers to the world's problems, Jesus does. It is only through faith in the one who defeated death on the cross that we can have hope."
