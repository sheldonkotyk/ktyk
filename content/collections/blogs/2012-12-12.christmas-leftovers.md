Can you imagine the government making us go back to our birth place to get counted? We don’t even like to fill in a form every few years.'

They packed up some expensive perfumes and gold for gifts and started a trip, probably lasting many weeks if not months. They didn’t complain about airline fees and fuel surcharges like we do. They were more interested in kneeling before the King of the Jews, depending on God’s GPS, a shining star, to guide their way through the desert.'

        text: 'We have trouble getting to sleep as we think of all the things left to do. Mary and Joseph had issues finding a place to sleep, finally settling in a cave or a stable. The animals, although probably smelling quite awful, were a source of heat for Mary as she gave birth to the Savior of all mankind. A group of shepherds were told by angels to go and visit the brand new baby. They found Jesus laying in a manger. Imagine the distress they felt. These men knew what a manger was for. It was for the animals to eat food out of.'

The gift exchanges and work events are good too and there is nothing wrong with having an enjoyable time with our friends. We just need to remember that the reason for the season is so that God could come down to us and save the world, one life at a time.'
